# Assignment 2
This assignment is organized such that executables appear in a subdirectory entitled `build/`.

## Build
Run `make`, which will compile each executable and place them in the `build/` directory.

## Run
Run `make run`, which will run the project. You can edit the Makefile to change the command-line arguments passed into the program.

## Clean
Run `make clean` to remove the `build/` directory.
