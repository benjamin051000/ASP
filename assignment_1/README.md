# Assignment 1
This assignment is organized such that executables appear in a subdirectory entitled `build/`. This requires changes to the `run.sh` file, since the executable paths are now different. Please keep this in mind and use my `run.sh` instead, which accounts for this subdirectory. Instructions on what to do can be found below.

## Build
Run `make`, which will compile each executable and place them in the `build/` directory.

## Run
Run `make run`, which will run the `run.sh` script. Or, simply run `./run.sh` in your terminal.

## Clean
Run `make clean` to remove the `build/` directory.
